## Data
Geospatial data is at the core of Geocoders services. This data can be hard to work with, often in specialised spatial
formats that require specific domain knowledge and expensive GIS (Goespatial Information Systems) software, rarely complete
or easy to use. That is where Geocoders comes in. We have extensive experience in the Geospatial data world and
have done the heavy lifting for you.


Each country has their own unique set of challenges & complexities with regard to data. Countries have different ways
of capturing their data, not all countries have provinces, some use regions, thus making each country's data unique.
To spare you from this complexity we have designed an easy to use Unified Data Model (*UDM*).
A hierarchical relationship that allows for blazingly fast and easy to use APIs.

### Datamodel
The Geocoders datamodel currently consists of seven levels of hierarchy. Below is a diagram indicating the relationships
between each level.

### Availability
The amount of available data varies per country, thus this serves as a detailed data catalogue
as well a translation for local names to UDM.

## Netherlands
The Netherlands has an incredibly well structure and readily available geographical data.

## Belgium
Belgium's Flanders regions has data that is as extensive as that of The Netherlands.
Wollonia unfortunately does not yet have building Cadastral data available.


## Luxembourg
Luxembourg also have very extensive data available
